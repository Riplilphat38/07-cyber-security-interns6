`Unt!lD3@thcallmynam `

`Warw!thus666`

`2203660489`

`R0cks***HeavyM3tal!`

`jesuisfort`

`BANGALORE`

 2- Testing my passwords strength

 tool used: PASSWORDMONSTER
 
I used Bitwarden & PASSWORDMONSTER some online free password Checkers to check my passwords strength

3.Best Practices & Tips Learned from the Evaluation
--
1.Based on the test results, here are the key best practices for creating strong passwords:
Length is the Most Important Factor. A long password made of simple words can be much stronger than a short, complex one. Aim for at least 12-16 characters.
   
2.﻿﻿﻿Use Unpredictability. Avoid common words (password, summer), sequential patterns (12345, qwerty), and personal information (your name, birthday).
   
3. ﻿﻿﻿Embrace Passphrases. Create a password by stringing together 4-5 random, unrelated words. For example, Camera-Brick-Tree-Pencil is long and easy to remember but hard to crack. Make it even stronger by adding a number and symbol: Camera-Brick-Tree-Pencil$7.
   
4. ﻿﻿﻿Complexity Still Matters. Within your long passphrase, mix in uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Don't just put the symbol at the end.
   
5. ﻿﻿﻿Avoid Common Substitutions ("Leetspeak"). Hackers' cracking tools are programmed to try @ for "a", O for "o", 3 for "e", etc. POssword is not a strong password.
     
6. ﻿﻿﻿Uniqueness is Critical. Use a different password for every single account. This prevents a breach at one service from compromising all your other accounts.
    
7. ﻿﻿﻿Use a Password Manager. Remembering dozens of long, complex, and unique passwords is impossible for a human. A password manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass) generates, stores, and auto-fills them for you. You only need to remember one strong master password.
   
4. Common Password Attacks(Brute Force, Dictionary)
   --
 * Brute Force Attack: This is a "trial and error" method where an attacker uses a program to systematically try every possible combination of characters until it finds the correct password. The time it takes depends entirely on the password's length and complexity.
 * 
* Dictionary Attack: A more efficient version of a brute force attack. Instead of trying every random combination, the program tries a list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords (e.g., password, letmein, admin123). This attack quickly breaks passwords based on single dictionary words.
* 
  8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security
  --

Password complexity (using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and length directly increase the
computational effort required to crack a password through brute force or dictionary attacks.
* ﻿﻿A short, simple password (e.g., cat) has very few possible combinations, so it can be cracked instantly.
* 
* ﻿﻿Adding complexity to a short password (e.g., COt!) increases the number of possible combinations per character, but because it's short, the total number of possibilities is still low. It might take minutes or hours to crack.
  
* ﻿﻿Increasing length (e.g., black-cat-sleep) has a massive impact. Each additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations. A 16-character passphrase can take centuries to brute force.
* 
* ﻿﻿Combining length with complexity (e.g., B1@ck-COt-S133p!) is the most effective strategy. It defends against both brute-force attacks (due to length and complexity) and dictionary attacks (due to the use of multiple, modified words).
* 
In essence, complexity makes each character position more unpredictable, while length multiplies this unpredictability, creating a formidable barrier that is economically and practically infeasible for attackers to break.
